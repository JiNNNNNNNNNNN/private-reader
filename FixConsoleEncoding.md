# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
- User provided log snippet showing garbled Chinese characters in IDEA console.
- Log files are reported to be normal.
- Code snippet `private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getInstance(NotificationServiceImpl.class);` indicates usage of `com.intellij.openapi.diagnostic.Logger`.
- Codebase search confirms widespread use of `com.intellij.openapi.diagnostic.Logger`.
- The issue is likely related to IDEA's console encoding settings or JVM options for the run configuration.

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
The primary approach is to systematically check and adjust IntelliJ IDEA's encoding-related settings:
1.  IDEA Console default encoding.
2.  Run/Debug configuration VM options and encoding settings.
3.  Global and Project file encoding settings.
4.  IDEA custom VM options file.
5.  (Optional/Advanced) Windows system locale settings for UTF-8 support.

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)
Implementation Checklist:
1. Check and modify IDEA console default encoding to UTF-8.
2. Check and modify Run/Debug Configurations: add/modify `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` and `-Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8` in VM options.
3. Check and modify IDEA global and project file encodings to UTF-8.
4. Check and modify IDEA custom VM options file (`.vmoptions`) to include `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` and `-Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8`.
5. (Optional) Check Windows system region settings for Beta UTF-8 support.
